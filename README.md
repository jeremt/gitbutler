=========

Simple but powerful UI for GIT.

TODO
----

- cmd+0, show command prompt instead of nav and autocomplete any command
- Merge branches by drag'n drop
- Ask user reset or patch when push force by someone else
- Handle when detached from head
- Replace commit prompt by Skip/Continue/Abort when rebasing

BUGS
----

- Error when trying to log on branch with no remote (display only local commits when no upstream)
- Buttons on Create and Clone overlays doesnt work...
