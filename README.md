Simple but powerful UI for GIT.

TODO
----

- cmd+0, show command prompt instead of nav and autocomplete any command
- overlay popups
    - Create/Clone repository
    - Show diff
- Merge branches by drag'n drop
- Ask user reset or patch when push force by someone else
- Special conflicts UI: showing the current conflicted file in fullscreen
- Handle when detached from head
- Add alert.info("Pushing data to remote 'origin/mybranch'...") 
- Add alert.info("Pulling data from remote 'origin/mybranch'...") 

BUGS
----

- Error when trying to log on branch with no remote (display only local commits when no upstream)
