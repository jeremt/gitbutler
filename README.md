Simple but powerful UI for GIT.

TODO
----

- cmd+0, show command prompt instead of nav and autocomplete any command
- overlay popups
    - Create/Clone repository
    - Show diff
- Merge branches by drag'n drop
- Add footer error/success notifications
- Ask user reset or patch when push force by someone else
- Automatic conflit resolving by showing the current conflicted file in fullscreen

BUGS
----

- the program become very slow when you often change the current repository
